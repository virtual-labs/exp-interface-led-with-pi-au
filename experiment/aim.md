### Aim of the Experiment

The objective of this experiment is to interface an LED with a Raspberry Pi and develop a Python program that controls the LED's state. Specifically, the program will turn the LED ON for a duration of 1 second, followed by turning it OFF for 2 seconds, repeating this cycle indefinitely. This task will help in understanding the basic functionality of the General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi and how to control external hardware via programming.

##### Applications of GPIO-Controlled LED Projects -->

This experiment demonstrates the core concepts of interfacing with GPIO pins and controlling external devices. The skills learned here are applicable to various real-world applications, such as:

1. Basic Indicator Systems:
   - LEDs are commonly used to indicate the status of a device, such as showing whether a system is powered on or functioning correctly.
   - Example: An LED indicator to signal when a device is in standby or operating mode.

2. Embedded Systems Development:
   - Understanding GPIO pin control is fundamental for developing embedded systems where devices interact with sensors, actuators, and displays.
   - Example: A microcontroller-based alarm system that uses LEDs to signal alerts.

3. Home Automation:
   - GPIO pins can control LEDs in smart home projects, such as controlling lights remotely or creating feedback loops for system status.
   - Example: An automated lighting system that turns lights ON/OFF based on sensor data.

4. Internet of Things (IoT) Projects:
   - Interfacing LEDs with Raspberry Pi enables basic feedback systems, which are often used in IoT devices that monitor and display data.
   - Example: A smart sensor system with LED indicators to show environmental conditions like temperature or humidity levels.

5. Prototyping for Consumer Electronics:
   - LEDs are frequently used in the prototyping phase of new electronic devices, helping developers quickly test and visualize circuit designs.
   - Example: Prototyping a new handheld device with visual feedback via LEDs.
